# EZ Password
An android app to generate strong passwords easy to remember and hard to crack

## Background
Most of the websites these days require passwords with more complexity. Usually they require a combination of:
  - Uppercase letters
  - lowercase letters
  - Special characters and 
  - Numbers

It is difficult to remember a password with these and many people use a password manager to record and organize their passwords for various websites. The generators in these managers ususally generate a gibberish sequence of characters to match the constraits.

## Solution
This is where we come in. The purpose of this app is to generate passwords which are easy to remember and adhere to those complexity requirements. We achieve this by using combination of words. Optionally, capitalize the first letter of words, replace certain letters with similar looking numbers and special characters. For Example, `Germ@nOfVan!lla`
